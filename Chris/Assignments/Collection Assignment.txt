2 – Cricket Score Analyzer
Create a Class ScoreAnalyzer with a private instance variable 'runsData' of type LinkedList.
The linkedlist will store runs scored by individual players in One Day Cricket match.
Create a constructor and initialize runsData variable.

•	Create a method addRunsToList which accepts runs scored by a player as parameter and stores it in the List.
•	Create a method calcRunRate which returns the runRate (Consider all 50 overs were played by a team).
•	Create a method lowestRunsScored to return the lowest runs scored by a player.
•	Create a method displayRuns to display the runs scored by all players.(use for each loop)

Create class TestScoreAnalyzer with a main method. 
•	Create an object of ScoreAnalyzer
•	Use Scanner to get the runs scored and use addRuns method to store the runs
•	Display the runs scored by all players
•	Display the runrate
•	Display the lowest runs scored
•	Display the count of player who did batting

Sample input
Enter Runs
20 30 150 50 2
 
Sample Output
Runs Scored : 1-20 2-30 3-150 4-50 6-2
Runrate : 5.04
Lowest Runs : 2
Count of player who batted: 5



3 – ScoreCard

4 – Patient List - Comparable and Comparator
Create a class Patient with private instance variables patientId (int), name(String) and age(int). Include parameterized Constructor and Getters/Setters

Create a class TestPatientList with a main method.
•	Create 3 objects of patient and add to an ArrayList
•	Sort the List based on Name which should be the natural order and display using for each loop
•	Sort the List based on age which should be the alternate sorting order and display using Iterator
•	Add all the objects in to a TreeSet and display the TreeSet
•	Create a static method getPatientAge which accepts name of the patient and TreeSet of patient. Method should return the age of patient. Invoke this method in the main method.



5 – Duplicate Patient - HashCode and Equals
Use the Patient class created in earlier assignment and modify if needed.

Create a class TestPatientSet with a main method.
•	Create 3 objects of patient and add to a LinkedHashSet. One of the patient should be a duplicate
•	Display the size of the Set.
•	Display the patient details for all patients


6 – States
A File named states.txt contains the following data

Karnataka
Punjab
Telangana
Maharashtra
TamilNadu
Uttar Pradesh
Punjab
Karnataka
Kerala
Delhi

Create a program to store the names of states of India in a LinkedHashSet named stateSet by reading the file.  ( Use readLine method of BufferedReader )

The program should do the following:
•	Display the total number of states
•	Remove Delhi from the Set
•	Display the states which have name starting with K
